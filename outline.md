## Data Structures

- Basic Data Structures
    - Static Data Structures
        - Arrays and Lists
        - Associative Arrays and Dictionaries
            - Mapping one piece of data to another
    - Dynamic Data Structures
        - Linked Lists
            - Implementation
            - Specializations
                - Doubly-linked lists
                - Circularly linked lists
                - Skip lists

- Abstract Data Structures 
    - Arrays and linked lists are the basis for building these more complex data structures

    - Stacks
        - Last in, First out (LIFO) structure
        - Implementation: Array based
        - Implementation: Linked List based
    - Queues
        - First in, First out (FIFO) structure
        - Implementation: Array based
        - Implementation: Linked List based
        - Specializations:
            - Double-ended queue (deque)
            - Priority queue
    - Trees
        - Hierarchical structure
        - Implementation
        - Specializations:
            - Binary Trees
            - 2-3 Trees
            - B-trees
            - Red-black trees
        - Tries
            - prefix tree
    - Graphs
        - Provides abstract connection between data
        - Implementation: Adjacency list
        - Implementation: Adjacency matrix
    - Hash tables
        - Uses functions to implement mapping
        - Implementation: Array based collision handling
        - Implementation: Linked list based collision handling
        - Implementation: Rehashing collision handling
    - Sets
        - Stores unique unordered data in a collection
        - Implementation

- Algorithms
