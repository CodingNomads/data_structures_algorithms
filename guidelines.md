# Data Structures and Algorithms Guidelines

This document is a short overview of the writing guidelines used for the CodingNomads Data Structures and Algorithms course.

## Writing Guidelines

The complete set of writing guidelines can be found in the [CodingNomads Course Creation Guide](https://codingnomads.github.io/creator-docs/). Here is an extremely brief summary:

1. Chapters are written in [Markdown](https://codingnomads.github.io/creator-docs/02-markdown-course-creation/).
2. Usse [code blocks] for long code passages, and backticks for inline code.
3. Your chapters should follow the [Read-Watch-Code-Reflect](https://codingnomads.github.io/creator-docs/00-basics/) cycle.
4. Each chapter should have a quiz section, and at least one lab challenge.
5. Video lessons are always a good addition as well --- reach out if you need assistance putting one together.

Check out existing courses for the flow and structure --- steal the layout and flow if you have to. You should also seek out other authors to read your text and provide feedback.
