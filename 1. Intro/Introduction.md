## About This Course

The CodingNomads Data Structures and Algorithms course covers topics which are typically part of a Computer Science degree program, but which are not often covered in depth in other courses.

Throughout this course, you will learn about various data structures used for storing and retrieving data in efficient ways, including:

- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Sets

You will also learn several important algorithms which use those data structures to search, sort, and manipulate data to answer questions and solve problems, including:

- Computational Complexity and Big-O Notation
- Depth-First and Breadth-First Searching
- Sorting
- Finding the Shortest Path
- Parsing Expressions
- Spell Checking
- Regular Expressions
- Data Compression

These data structures and algorithms are present in software used every day by millions of people. From business applications to financial software to machine learning to casual games, these ideas represent the basis for most modern software. Knowing what they are and how to use them makes you a more proficient coder and increases your value to potential employers.

So let's get stuck in!
